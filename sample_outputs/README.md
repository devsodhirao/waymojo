# Sample Output Images

This directory contains sample output images from running YOLOv3 inference on the KITTI dataset.

## Directories

- `final_output/`: Sample images from running inference with final settings
- `output/`: Sample images from initial disparity map inference
- `rgb_output/`: Sample images from RGB image inference

Each directory contains a few representative samples. When running the scripts, your own output will be generated in similar directories.
